            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.</p>
            
            <h2>Card Values</h2>
            <p>Face cards are worth 10, Aces can be worth 1 or 11, and other cards are worth their face value.</p>
            
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player is dealt two cards.</li>
                <li>The dealer also gets two cards, with one face up.</li>
                <li>Players can choose to "Hit" to get another card or "Stand" to keep their hand.</li>
                <li>If a player's total exceeds 21, they "Bust" and lose the round.</li>
                <li>The dealer must hit until they reach at least 17.</li>
                <li>The winner is the one with the closest total to 21 without exceeding it.</li>
